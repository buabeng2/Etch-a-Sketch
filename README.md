# Etch-a-Sketch
This project mainly relies on JavaScript in order to implement a web-based application similar to a real-life Etch-A-Sketch. In this application,
The user can modulate the pixel sizes and dimensions of the board in order to design their unique drawings and styles. Further work will 
include the implementation of JQuery to have more of a click and mouse feature as compared to a hover feature for drawing purposes
